# SlaamMono
SlaamMono is a port of Slaam from Zune XNA to MonoGame. It is based on an old publicly released copy. 

I am converting it over to pc, recreating assets, and generally revamping all the programming as it was done years ago before I knew a lot about proper object oriented programming.

## Current Plan

Right now I'm in the process of cleaning up the code. I want to pull out the general game engine stuff into it's own class library.
